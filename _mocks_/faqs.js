      "How this works is I will invoice you for the said total amount. Once the invoice has been settled I will share with you the online questionnaire form that I use to gather all the necessary details about your business to ensure I create the best possible logo for you. Once I have all your details I will schedule your logo for the initial concept. Once the initial concept is ready I will share it with you here for your feedback. All logos I design comes with 5 complimentary revisions. This means you can request up to 5 separate times for me to make edits/changes to the initial concept until you are 100% satisfied with the outcome.",
